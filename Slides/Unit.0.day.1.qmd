# Value of Economics

## What do you think economists do?

## What do economists actually do?

![](img/Andersen%20unit%200%20-%20Thursday0.png)

-   Economists use theoretical and empirical models to:
    -   Evaluate programs

-   Economists use theoretical and empirical models to:
    -   Evaluate programs
    -   Study human behavior

-   Economists use theoretical and empirical models to:
    -   Evaluate programs
    -   Study human behavior
    -   Explain social phenomena

## Why study (micro) economics?

Provides a theoretical model of how the world “works”

Develops analytical thinking and critical problem-solving skills

Supports the acquisition of valuable quantitative, statistical, data, and computer skills

Helps to formulate and analyze both business strategies and public policies

## What makes an economist an economist?

-   Economists apply two key ideas
    -   Marginal thinking—what (usually) matters are small changes, not big ones
    -   Rational decision making—people will maximize their surplus (marginal benefit net of marginal cost)
-   In this class we will:
    -   Learn what marginal analysis means
    -   Develop concepts of supply and demand for goods and services
    -   Use supply and demand to understand consumer (you) and firm (the boss) behavior
    -   Understand when government intervention can make society better (or worse) off

## Thinking like an economist – How much should you study?

![](img/Andersen%20unit%200%20-%20Thursday3.jpg)

-   Imagine that you can spend your time
    -   Partying
    -   Studying

![](img/Andersen%20unit%200%20-%20Thursday4.jpg)

-   Imagine that you can spend your time
    -   Partying
    -   Studying
-   How do you decide what to do?
-   Let’s start with the benefit of spending time studying or partying
    -   Studying appears to provide the biggest benefit, so should you spend all of your time studying?
-   NO
-   Rather than looking at TOTAL benefit, let’s think about MARGINAL benefit
    -   Marginal benefit is the additional benefit you get from spending one more minute doing something
-   The first few minutes provide the most benefit
-   We will learn that maximizing total benefit requires equalizing marginal benefits

## How much should you study?

-   This person is allocating four hours (240 minutes) between partying and studying
    -   Every minute spent studying decreases time spent partying
    -   Forces a a trade-off between partying and studying
-   Redoing the graph using “Minutes spent studying” highlights this tradeoff
-   “Goldilocks point” or “equilibrium”
    -   Where marginal benefit of studying=marginal benefit of partying

## How much should you study?(attendance question)

## How much should you study?

-   This is an example of:
    -   Marginal analysis
        -   The benefit of spending an additional minute in each activity
    -   Opportunity cost
        -   Formalizes the trade-off
    -   Equilibrium
-   We will work on these ideas in units 2 through 5
